## Overview
The goal of the capstone project was to create an R package that simplifies the process of searching and retrieving articles from the PubMed database. This project aims to provide an intuitive interface and R wrapper function to quickly obtain relevant article information in a formatted data frame. The main features of this project include sending queries to PubMed, processing the returned XML data, and extracting the relevant information. 
This project will be particularly useful for my internship.


## Tasks and Technical Difficulties

The following tasks were identified to achieve the goals of the project:

1. Develop R wrapper function to interact with the PubMed API.
2. Implement functions to parse the XML data returned by the PubMed API.
3. Extract relevant information from the parsed XML data.
4. Create an R package to host the wrapper functions and related utilities.

 During the project, several technical difficulties were encountered:

* Passing a large number of article IDs in a single query.
``` 
pubmed_abstract <- function(db , ids = NULL, 
                         retmode = "abstract", rettype = "xml") {
  ids_str <- paste(ids, collapse = ",")
  url <- glue("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db={db}&id={ids_str}&retmode={retmode}&rettype={rettype}&api_key={api_key}")

  response <- httr::GET(url)
  doc <- read_xml(response)
  abstracts <- xml_find_all(doc, ".//AbstractText") %>% 
    xml_text()

  return(abstracts)
}
```
* Processing a single giant HTTP response from the API.
```
res <- httr::POST(url = fetch_url, body = params, encode = "form")
  sum <- content(res, "text") %>% read_xml()
  sum <- glue("{base_address}{fetch_url}") %>% 
    httr::GET() %>% 
    content("text") %>% 
    read_xml()
  return(sum)
```
* Resolving an error in the HTTP2 framing layer (curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle)).

## Project Progress and Challenges
Despite the technical challenges, the project progressed as follows:

- R wrapper functions were successfully created to send queries to the PubMed API.
- Functions to parse the XML data were implemented and tested.
- Relevant information was successfully extracted from the parsed XML data and returned as a data frame.

  However, some issues could not be resolved during the project:

The error in the HTTP2 framing layer persisted, causing difficulties in retrieving data from the PubMed API.

## Practical Outcomes
The resulting R package, pubmedart, provides users with an easy-to-use interface for retrieving PubMed articles. The package allows researchers to focus on their research questions instead of spending time on data retrieval and processing tasks. While the package has been successful in achieving most of its goals, some limitations remain due to the unresolved HTTP2 framing layer error. 
Future work on the project may involve identifying the causes of this error and implementing a solution to ensure that the package functions seamlessly and improving the function in order to work with other databases from the NCBI.

## Conclusion
The capstone project aimed to create an R package for searching and retrieving articles from the PubMed database. Despite encountering some technical challenges, the project successfully developed the pubmedart package, which provides an intuitive interface and R wrapper functions to help researchers obtain relevant article information quickly. While there are some limitations due to unresolved issues, the package has the potential to significantly streamline the process of working with PubMed data in R.

## Additional Analysis: Endometriosis Infertility Articles
To demonstrate the usefulness of the pubmedart package, a set of articles related to endometriosis infertility was analyzed.
